- 👋 Hi, I’m @jroques12
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a software developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything interesting or challenging


I would love to get a job as a software developer. I made some unfortunate choices as a youth that led me to forsake of schooling and now that I have a
family it is even more challenging to set time aside to work on and refine my craft but I am dedicated to the continued learning of coding.
